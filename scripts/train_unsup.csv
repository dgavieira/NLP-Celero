"I admit, the great majority of films released before say 1933 are just not for me. Of the dozen or so ""major"" silents I have viewed, one I loved (The Crowd), and two were very good (The Last Command and City Lights, that latter Chaplin circa 1931).<br /><br />So I was apprehensive about this one, and humor is often difficult to appreciate (uh, enjoy) decades later. I did like the lead actors, but thought little of the film.<br /><br />One intriguing sequence. Early on, the guys are supposed to get ""de-loused"" and for about three minutes, fully dressed, do some schtick. In the background, perhaps three dozen men pass by, all naked, white and black (WWI ?), and for most, their butts, part or full backside, are shown. Was this an early variation of beefcake courtesy of Howard Hughes?","Finally, I got to see this legendary masterpiece on TV. When I first heard that there was an Arabian movie featuring the Western icon ""Hopalong Cassidy""(William Boyd) and the Gothic icon Boris Karloff, the idea sounded like a disparate joke. (Actually, Karloff only plays a brief, minor role, being new to the silver screen at that time.) <br /><br />The script is very original. The shooting is excellent for the times. And the acting is so well done, you feel what the characters feel, and can easily read the actors' lips for practically every line. Unlike many silent-era films, you get the sensation that you are in this one.<br /><br />The comedy starts right from the opening scene, and I will describe it only to illustrate the unexpected silliness of William Boyd: He is in a night battle in World War I, and drops into a shell crater to avoid German gunfire. His 1st Sergeant, a bully and a brute whom he despises, had just fallen in before him, and is unconscious. Boyd tries to revive him until he sees who he is, and starts slinging mud on the Sergeant's face. He revives and they immediately jump into a fistfight in the mud. When a flare illuminates the night sky, they look up and see the hole is surrounded with numerous Germans with bayonets. The enemy was having a time watching them fight each other! It is an eye opener to see the future Hopalong Cassidy in a real cut-up comedy role, back when he looked like a very young cross between Marlon Brando and Jack Haley.<br /><br />I was very impressed with the nitty-gritty reality in this film about POW's of World War I, in an era when glossed-over heroics and reality-denial dominated war films. Moreover, there is often a timeless feeling, especially during the POW camp scenes, which gives the viewer a sense of closeness to the people of that era; and the understanding that people have at all times in history been, in their own way, ""modern.""<br /><br />The dual-based plot, (survival and escape, and later a pursuit of romance), rolls steadily through ever-changing backgrounds. The factors of comedy, action, danger, and romance blend harmoniously throughout. The relationship between Boyd's and Wolheim's characters develop from utter hatred, to enduring animosity, to forced survival cooperation, to mild mutual suspiciousness, to amorous competition, to strong friendship.<br /><br />Though this is a silent film from 1927, centered on World War I in Europe and Turkey, I have never had such a modern and timeless feeling from a silent movie. This results from the cool, timeless acting and characterizations, and the excellent directing and shooting.<br /><br />This is the first silent drammatic film my kids have thoroughly enjoyed, (until now only preferring silent comedic standards by Keaton, Chaplin, and Harold Lloyd.)","Watching this film was like reliving the jobs I had in my 20's - waiting for 5 o'clock, looking busy, trying to impress people who didn't give two hoots about you, and the dreams...ah, the dreams...<br /><br />This is a very believable study of working life for the bottom rung female. How they band together, then fall apart. It's ultimately a sad story with some hope for 2 of the characters. But it's as close to life as it gets.<br /><br />Wonderful performances by all 4 actresses. And small roles by some big character actors make this a good film.","Evocative, funny look at four women stuck in temporary employment, and not all that thrilled at being there. Solid ensemble work from the four leads, with Posey (as usual) stealing scenes from her costars. The only flaw is that the film verges on becoming boring sometimes itself, which is really just a tribute to how well it is presenting its subject, and possibly the point.","I thought I'd do a quick review. Actually I didn't really ever plan on watching this movie. Frankly the words ""Lisa Kudrow"" and movie just make shudder, but a friend who's taste in movies is just a bit different then my own suggested it so when I saw it playing on TMN I thought I'd watch it. The movie Office Space came to mind on more then on occasion while watching this. I do give Office Space a slightly higher rating, but the two movies are not that unalike in their styles. Both are subtle, intelligent comedies that challenge the viewer. I've said this about other movies and it applies here too, if you want to be spoon fed your laughs rent Ace Ventura. If you've ever sat in an Office with nothing to do for 8 hours, rent this movie (it only takes 2).","Clockwatchers surprised me in many ways. At first I thought was just going to be a quirky comedy about resentful temps, I was wrong. There were many things in this satire that came unexpected. I was surprised with it's meticulousness, every scene looks like it was arranged to resemble an office to the slightest details. You can strongly feel that dry and dead air, and the way everything seems to move without any change, in a monotonous pattern that will slowly but surely kill you're personal energy. I never knew that an office could feel so oppressive, and this film portrays it was successful accuracy. Another thing that surprised me was the unexpected seriousness, I actually found myself thinking about some of the character's observations on careers and goals, how sometimes we can totally lose our identity when all we try to do is to please others and maintain a decent salary. When ""Clockwatchers"" was over, I actually found myself depressed, and menaced by the possibility that my life could turn out like the characters'. But, bleak elements aside, this was also a pretty funny film as well. Parker Posey delivers a juicy performance, her pessimism never ceases to entertain. The other actresses are also good, and most of the scenes they share together are enjoyable to watch. The only thing that could of used some fixing was the film's last half hour, it dragged on with the whole ""new girl"" plotline and the final conclusion was too vague to satisfy. But still, ""Clockwatcher"" is a good film, a unique blend of snappy humour and depressing accuracy that usually succeeds.","Transcendently beautiful in moments outside the office, it seems almost sitcom-like in those scenes. When Toni Colette walks out and ponders life silently, it's gorgeous.<br /><br />The movie doesn't seem to decide whether it's slapstick, farce, magical realism, or drama, but the best of it doesn't matter. (The worst is sort of tedious - like Office Space with less humor.)","I have been an office temp, and this portrays the way I felt all too well. As others have pointed out, it is more than a Dilbert spinoff, however. Sprecher does an excellent job of capturing the sense of floating and disconnectedness, to use Margaret's words, in modern society. We have a bittersweet, ironic story of an individual 'coming of age' as her group of friends breaks apart. Parker Posey's sassy and cynical character pulled me into this movie. Toni Collette at times could be mistaken for a less annoyingly neurotic Ally McBeal. Lisa Kudrow's role is familiar, yet tragic instead of comic. Alanna Ubach's character is less developed, as she seems to present an alternative -- she trades her current unhappiness for the traditional misery of a poor marriage.<br /><br />At the end Iris manipulates the barren work environment to her advantage. Perhaps there is hope for us after all.","I've been reading the comments and I'm not surprised that others find this movie boring. It's not for anyone with a limited attention span. I don't have one of those and I thought this was a very interesting, if not somewhat sad look at the world of employment whether it be temp or permanent. I guess everyone wants to fit in-whether it be your job or school. If you can find some little niche that you do belong in enjoy it because sometimes that fit never lasts. I think that's what happened in this movie. The 4 main characters fit in with each other because they were temps and had that little thing in common. But what else they had in common is not clear and I think it wasn't enough to hold the little group together. Sure, we can blame it on the thief plot but in the long run relationships like that don't last because they have very little in common. As for the new girl Cleo I actually felt sorry for her-she was such a lonely soul and it seemed she tried to make friends with those 4 but they didn't want to include her in. She paid Iris a compliment and also said hi but all she did was stare back at her-funny coming from those who complain about being ignored by the permanent workers because they were temps. She stole the things from everyone because it gave her a part of them since she didn't make friends with anyone.I can really feel for the Cleo character. The four main characters are a case study in themselves. But they were a hoot and so much like those that I've come across in life. And that's why I like this movie-the characters are real.","Clockwatchers is a very funny little film that sheds light on the frustrations of spending eight hours a day in an entirely unexceptional environment where every action has been reduced to routine. The main characters are four women who entered the working world with hopes of making a life for themselves that would set them apart from the rest of the rat race, but had their dreams dashed when they realized that in today's crowded job market they had to take what they could get. They ended up with desk space in a sterile, faceless office where they depend on their sense of humor and respect for one another to get through the day.<br /><br />This is a story that depends strongly on dialogue and character development to keep the viewer interested. It largely works, with a lot of amusing moments and sharp dialogue throughout, as well as keen observations about the humdrum existence too many of us lead. The always likeable Parker Posey has a terrific performance as the most rebellious and plainspoken of the group. There's also Bob Balaban playing his usual fussy nebbish character, this time as a meticulous number cruncher who can't let go of his pencils. In its second half, however, the story surrenders to the pessimism it tries to battle; the tone shifts from `Dilbert' to Kafka, and some of the characters suddenly become cold and unsympathetic. Nevertheless, it remains insightful and entertaining, something to which the average working stiff could relate.<br /><br />","This was clearly written by someone who has gone through the mind numbing, soul snatching experience of being a temp. It captures the self-worthlessness perfectly and also the stupidity of modern corporate America today.","This is a very strange film that was long thought to be forgotten. It's the story of two American Army buddies, William Boyd (aka ""Hopalong Cassidy"") and Louis Wolheim, and their adventures as they manage to escape from a German prison camp during WWI. However, as this is a comedy, the duo manage to make the most round about and stupid escape--accidentally boarding a train to Constantinople to be placed in a Turkish prisoner of war camp! On the way, they manage to escape once again and end up in quite the adventure--meeting sexy Mary Astor along the way.<br /><br />As far as the film goes, it was a rather funny script and despite being a silly plot, it worked rather well. The chemistry between Boyd and Wolheim worked and the film managed to be quite entertaining. Oddly, however, the film managed to beat out Harold Lloyd's film, SPEEDY, for an Oscar for Best Direction for a Comedy (a category no longer used)--as SPEEDY was a superior film in most ways (it's one of Lloyd's best films). Still, it's well worth a look--especially if you love silent films.<br /><br />By the way, director Milestone and Louis Walheim would team up just a few years later for another WWI picture, the great ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT--a film that is definitely NOT a comedy.","For some reason I'd been resisting seeing this film until a friend thrust it into my hands and said, ""C'mon, Toni Collette and Parker Posey, how can you go wrong?""<br /><br />Maybe I was resisting because I didn't want to see my life up there on the screen. Currently working in a temp job (where I am typing this review), ""Clockwatchers"" is terrifyingly familiar. It's not a hilarious comedy, although it is quite funny. Certain moments threaten to veer into David Lynch-style self-conscious surrealism, but the director reigns these moments in, in the nick of time.<br /><br />It's a film about small things happening in an enclosed space, and the friendships that grow between the most unlikely of people, due mostly to proximity. The mood of paranoia that emerges in the second half of the film is perfect - turning trivialities into monumental acts of anarchy and betrayal. The office becomes a sealed microcosm where the theft of a tiny plastic monkey becomes the end of the world.<br /><br />Not everyone is going to understand this film - it's not ""Office Space"", which is more accessibly 'wacky'. You're not going to chuck it on with your mates and have a good laugh. It's much more sombre and serious and ultimately quite sad. And it's made me quit my job (so perhaps I should have given it 10 stars, just for that).","Funny women Posey and Kudrow star in this popular indie film about office temps in the city and the none-too-bright future they have in this increasingly paranoid and indifferent job field (if it can even be considered one.)<br /><br />A lot of cute office shtick in the beginning (though nothing you haven't seen done better in ""Clerks"" and ""Office Space""), but the climatic story of the office-snitch is what killed it for me. Completely cliché and predictable. If you don't know who it is the moment the drama starts you have seen very few movies in your day and the character herself (no I won't spoil) is a tried and true trite stereotype that is more plot device than any character at all. <br /><br />Still both an amusing and somber look at this joke of a job ""opportunity"" that awaits many a young woman. The cast is very good, I wish the story would have been better written. I disagree with the critics, ""Party Girl"" was a much better showcase for Parker Posey. That film had me laughing from start to finish and without rolling clichés in the plot.","I have never worked as an office temp before, but after seeing this movie, I have a very clear image as to what it must be like. The film does a perfect job of making the viewer feel like part of the office community (which isn't always a good thing to want to feel). After the movie was over, I felt somewhat void and numb - and very tired. That is the exact effect that this film should have. The business world allows for no individuality or creativity - instead, it silences one's spirit.<br /><br />Toni Collette is wonderful as Iris. I have known so many people like this character - quiet, shy, someone who lets life go by without making his/her mark. I have also known many people like Margaret (Parker Posey) - people who need to be seen and heard at all times. And this one of Parker's greatest performances. She goes from a bouncy free-spirit to an aggressive troublemaker to an outcast without warning, and her transformation is fascinating to watch. Lisa Kudrow, too, gives another great performance (and this was before her scene-stealing role in ""The Opposite of Sex"") as the possibly compulsive liar Paula. The fourth actress, Alannah Ubach, I have not seen in anything else, but she is absolutely a delight to watch. Smaller roles by actors such as Jamie Kennedy, Bob Balaban (Posey's costar in ""Waiting For Guffman""), and David James Elliot are also performed with perfection. If you appreciate a movie about interesting characters in everyday situations, then this is a movie for you. Many people have complained about the slow pace, but I have never found this to be boring. The slow pace is effective in making viewers feel as desperate and unimportant as the temps. 9/10","The four leads are very effective as the disaffected temps, pariahs in a generic office. They are ably supported by veterans such as Stanley De Santis and Bob Balaban. For its first forty minutes, Clockwatchers effectively creates a Twilight-Zonish office hierarchical atmosphere with our heroines as the office pariahs. Then it spends its last hour expounding upon the fragile and transitory nature of office friendships amidst corporate backstabbing for advancement and survival -- especially among temps. After the first hour, it is the viewer who is the clockwatcher as it winds down with no additional insights, humor, or surprises. I'd give the first half a 7, and the second half a 1, which leaves me with a 4.","Even if it is the last movie in the video store and the vendor offers it to you free, do not waste your time. Between catching up on my sleep and counting 'z's, I painfully watched 4 self loathing women in an office space taking full advantage of whatever thinking that it will improve sometime, even if all we do is watch the clock. Terrible waste of time. You could strap me to a chair, perform a root canal without freezing and blast Kenny G... instead of torturing me to watch this awful movie again. Videostore owners... do not put a satisfaction guarantee on it, my wife took the film back to Blockbuster and demanded a credit!","This film is about the minutiae of office work as experienced by four female office workers.<br /><br />It is a film without a single redeeming feature. It was so bad and so boring, that it was fascinating. For all those that believe office work and office life is largely pointless and the ultimate in tedium and boredom, this film will confirm it.<br /><br />Why was it made, and how did its makers ever raise the funds?","Could call this four actresses in search of a story.I felt bludgeoned with the message of helplessness in the workplace. Maybe it would work in a job satisfaction seminar, but for a Saturday night , give me a break.","This is a very bleak film...if you're looking to unwind from work, this is exactly the wrong movie to watch. The characters are dull, the plot is dull, the temps are so helpless and constantly humiliated that it becomes painful to watch. Toni Collette's narration is annoying, precisely because it is obvious this is her coming of age story. Her big revelation at the end of the film is to dupe a superior into signing a recommendation letter as a favor to a friend. That's her big breakthrough after an hour and a half of being very mousey and shy. The four temps who look so playful and happy on the box cover are miserable in the movie, partly because they're temps and partly because they don't possess the ambition or skills to be much more than that. I was expecting a comedy, at least a black comedy, but this was a very bleak story of hopelessness and despair with the friendships evaporating due to mistrust of one another.","That is exactly what I did while watching this movie. I watched the clock, hoping it would end soon.","Many of you have posted comments on ""Clockwatchers"" as a portrayal of ""Office Life""... Not true!! It is a movie based on each of the 4 main characters personal ""Identity Struggle"" and nothing more than that. Watch it again and ""Forget"" that they are in an ""Office"" setting, focus on the personalities you see in each of the 4 main characters.<br /><br />I'll give you a hint, Lisa Kudrow's character has Bulimia Nervosa.<br /><br />Guess who has OCD?<br /><br />""Never ignore the Obvious and Never over-look the Obscure""<br /><br />A great Movie! 10 ""stars""","William Boyd and Louis Wolheim are the ""Two Arabian Knights"" referred to in the title, humorously. The pair start out as U.S. POWs trying to escape from the Germans during World War I. Eventually, they find themselves on board a ship bound for Arabia. While tripping out to the Middle East, they rescue an Arab woman, Mary Astor, who turns out to be a Princess; and, of course, becomes a romantic interest for the ""Two Arabian Knights"". No points for guessing who wins the veiled Ms. Astor!<br /><br />The film is very well photographed and directed; Lewis Milestone has wonderful sets, and stages scenes beautifully. Of the performances, Mr. Wolheim stands out - he creates a character so understandable you can almost hear him speak, trough the film is silent. The story isn't as strong as it could be - there are some events and sequences which had me wondering how and why the characters' locale changed. The last looks, exchanged between one of the stars and an extra, is an example of something I didn't understand. Perhaps these were comic bits which had a particular appeal for the time.<br /><br />The film is damaged in several places; but there is enough preserved, in even these scenes, to allow your mind to fill in the visual blanks. Boris Karloff appears as the ""Purser""; watch for his big scene on ship, when Wolheim goes into a room with him for some money (what actually happens is a mystery). Early in the film, there is a long scene with a lot of naked men shown from the waist up (or, thereabouts); they are POWs being herded to the showers. Director Milestone uses parades of soldiers moving to great effect; this ""shower"" scene is different in that several of the men don't look as Caucasian as you might expect - maybe not as many Caucasian men would agree to appear nude? <br /><br />******* Two Arabian Knights (9/23/27) Lewis Milestone ~ William Boyd, Louis Wolheim, Mary Astor","I enjoyed this movie. I rented it because it had Parker Posey in it, but enjoyed all of the characters. Maybe because I've had jobs like that before : the sense of ""us vs. them"" and the wacky little things that the characters did to get through the day to 5:00. I would rather watch a movie about these four girls than most movies readily offered to me. Watch the movie. Enjoy it. There aren't that many great movies where the female characters aren't just there to give a guy character some depth.","With the movie market being so saturated with cheesy action and overplayed drama flicks, what a breath of fresh air it is to see a movie about people that have REAL problems. Clockwatchers captures all the essences of the work place, the monotony, the hierarchy, and all the nuances of tedious day to day temp work. Here you have 4 women who are capable of so much more in their life, yet they're so afraid to act on their dreams that they settle for crappy temp jobs. Excellent acting by Toni Collette in the lead role as ""Iris."" Nods to Parker Posey as well. All the girls nailed their parts strongly, and the strong acting along with a great script created a very real and believable story with real and believable characters. Definitely see it! 4 stars!","I'm surprised how many people see this as a boring film that does nothing but chronicle the minutiae of modern-day office life. 'Clockwatchers' is a relationship film which also examines the lives of the new breed of second-class citizen in the late 20th century workplace, the temp.<br /><br />Iris (Toni Collette) is a meek temporary hire who stands out about as much as the Muzak at her new assignment, a large credit firm. Luckily she's taken under the wing of Margaret (Parker Posey), the Artful Dodger of the firm's temps who shows her how to survive in this impersonal world. Along with Paula (Lisa Kudrow) and Jane (Alanna Ubach) they form an us-against-them support group and Iris begins to come out of her shell as a person as well. Soon Margaret is conducting a guerilla war against a permanent hire (Helen FitzGerald) who gets a job Margaret had been aiming for and who is almost a mirror image of Iris when she came to work a few weeks before. The office drama is played out in great detail, and the solidarity of the temps is one of the war's casualties.<br /><br />This is a fine, above-average first effort from director Jill Sprecher, who wrote the screenplay with her sister Karen. She's obviously keen to show her skills here, and sometimes she directs the movie like it was 'Citizen Kane,' but that's not much of a fault. A little more serious problem is that after its climax the film loses some steam moving towards the denouement, but overall the screenwriting sisters have produced an entertaining film that speaks with authority on its subject. Let's hope they find regular employment.","When the credits started for ""Clockwatchers"" - Toni Collette, Parker Posey and Lisa Kudrow - the senior citizens around me in the art house theater complained they hadn't heard of anybody. (There were also choice bit roles by James Elliott of ""Jag,"" Bob Balaban and Paul Dooley and they didn't recognize them either.) There was a row of young kids in the front for some reason who talked as much as the seniors through the movie and kept going in and out to get food and slamming the door. All of which is hard to take during a comedy. <br /><br />This is a great movie for those of us in unsatisfactory office cubicle jobs - ideal for those in temp hell. Not necessarily laugh out loud funny all the way through but biting social satire about office life today for those at the bottom end of a ladder that doesn't go anywhere.<br /><br />Collette's central character is almost too bland and vacant towards the end as there's no ringing conclusion just some small revenges, but it's all in character and place. <br /><br />Kudrow gets to be a bit nastier and practical life-facing than her usual roles.<br /><br />Clearly the sister creators of this movie have spent some time as temps! And temporary office placement companies are now the largest employers in the country.<br /><br />(originally written 5/26/1998)","Is this movie slow? Occasionally boring? Kind of depressing? Yes. Unfortunately, that is the reality of working as a temp in an office! Take it from one who's been there. I spent several years temping on breaks from college in the late 80s, and this movie brought it all back, vividly. The office politics, the way the permanent workers ""look down"" on the temps, the menial and mind-numbing tasks, the good old boys (mostly white males, at that time) who were in charge and above it all. Not all of my jobs were as horrible as the office depicted in this movie, but enough were that it occasionally gave me chills. I hope that things have improved, with the proliferation of computers and other advanced technology, at least in terms of the work itself. But I can guarantee that in some places, that temp vs. perm ""caste system"" will always be there, regardless of how the jobs get done.<br /><br />The performances in the movie were excellent. I really liked Parker Posey's exuberant portrayal, as well as Toni Collette's studied, more subtle effort. She expresses so much pain and frustration through her facial expressions and quiet, even-toned narration.<br /><br />The movie is not for everyone, and some viewers will no doubt be bored and/or confused by it. But if you've ever been a temp of any kind, or worked in an office, I think it will resonate with you.","Blistering black comedy co-written by Jill Sprecher (who also directed) and Karen Sprecher, ""Clockwatchers"" gives us a suffocating office setting so vivid and real I half-expected my own co-workers to show up in it. Toni Collette plays the new temporary in a nondescript building wherein office-incidentals are slowly disappearing from the supply cabinet. The ensemble acting is delightfully accurate, and the strife which ensues in this scenario is comically overwrought and horrifying. Sprecher's direction is focused and brave (no overtures to broadly comical sensibilities), and she nimbly stretches the film's satirical edge quite far without faltering. The movie is a genuine American original, and by the final third I couldn't wait to see it again from the start. ***1/2 from ****","I saw this on cable last night, just 2 days after seeing the Sprecher sisters' latest film, 13 Conversations About One Thing - that was the reason I stayed up til 2:30 a.m. to watch it, in fact (please read my review of 13 Conversations, posted yesterday). This film is linear - one scene following the other chronologically - and therefore not as challenging to the viewer as 13 Conversations, but it does leave its mark (as one character in the movie has been told to do). <br /><br />Writer/Director Jill Sprecher is extremely adept in nailing down specifics, and this gift for detail is in full evidence here. The film is about fear, lunch hours, pettiness, toilet paper, loneliness, rubber band balls, despair, paper clips, friendship, pencils, desperation, cocktail garnishes, anger - downright fury, actually - at being marginalized by the illusion of society - and much more. Toni Collette's face is still in my memory - her terrified-to-do-or-say-the-wrong-thing rabbit eyes, her rapture at feeling connected to her 3 fellow temp workers (and specifically, seeing her nose crinkle the way it does when she smiles), the desolation of seeing their bond destroyed by wretched but inevitable bone-chilling office politics and fear. <br /><br />It's a small slice of life, Clockwatchers, but it's an important slice, one that anyone who has ever interacted with anyone on a daily, money-driven basis can relate to. If you've ever held a job, I'm saying, you will see yourself mirrored in at least some of these meticulous details.","Jill Sprecher, the enormous talent behind ""Clockwatchers"", needs to be seen more often. We saw this witty comedy in its original debut and it was a pleasure to watch it again on IFC. Ms. Sprecher and her sister Karen wrote a delicious movie that is on the one level a satire about the way ""temps"" are used in an office, and it's at the same time, a character study about these four souls at the center of the movie.<br /><br />Each one of the young women in the film has a problem. They come together because they don't have a life on their own. Iris, Margaret, Paula and Jane, form a bond because they find safety in numbers. Iris is a clever girl whose shyness doesn't let her assert herself and is dragged along by the others that show stronger personalities. Margaret puts up a front, but deep down, she is just as vulnerable as the others. The most pathetic one is Paula, a woman who is pretending to be what she is not. Jane is waiting for the security of marriage to beat it out of being a temp.<br /><br />When the sneaky Cleo is hired as a permanent employee, the problems in the office are magnified. As things begin disappearing from the office, all eyes point to the four temps. That is the beginning of the end of the clique, as they knew it. Iris is the one that stays the longer and she is the one that discovers the mystery of the missing things in the office, but alas, it's too late, because at that time she leaves the temp job.<br /><br />Toni Collette, Parker Posey, Lisa Kudrow and Alana Ubach, are perfect as the four temps. Toni Collette has a better role where to shine as most of the story is seen through her eyes. Parker Posey is delightful as the free spirited Margaret. Lisa Kudrow also makes a good contribution with her pathetic Paula. Helen Firzgerald, who only has a few lines, cast a giant shadow as the creepy new employee that wants to make friends with Iris, only to be ignored.<br /><br />The Sprecher sisters created a film that feels real a situation one has seen is prevalent in the office setting.","Some of the earlier reviewers have called ""Clockwatchers"" dull, pointless and have asked why it was made. My question for these reviewers is: What movie were you watching? Is there another movie with a similar title out there? This movie is incredible!<br /><br />No, it's not a ""There's Something About Mary"" farce. No, there aren't any explosion and no one is killed. (Someone does die... but that happens off camera and we don't see any blood.) The comedy here is of the subtle, ""funny because it is true"" variety. If you've ever had a job, any job, the comedy in this movie cannot escape you.<br /><br />Parker Posey once again shows us that she is one of the finest comic actresses alive. And, contrary to what others have said, this is not a one note performance. She is at once obnoxious, brash, funny and fun...and yet, very vulnerable, struggling so hard to be recognized and very terrified of where her life is headed.<br /><br />I could give similar praise to the performances of Toni Collette, Alanna Ubach and (believe it or not) Lisa Kudrow.<br /><br />Director Jill Sprecher (I will have to watch more from her) has aimed her dart at office politics: The pecking order, the self-absorption, the pointlessness of it all, the feeling of ""Oh, how I would I love to leave this place but where would next month's rent come from?""...and Jill has hit the bullseye!<br /><br />","I suppose the viewers who label Clockwatchers ""boring"" simply don't understand that dramas are MEANT to be slower than your garden-variety Indiana Jones or Die Hard. These ""action"" flicks are ten-times as dull as the corporate setting for this astonishing study on class, friendship, and inner-awareness. Or maybe it is the female perspective or ""chick-flick"" factor that turn certain people off. Or maybe temporary status in modern American business isn't relevant to everyone. Or the subtle, less gimmicky observations of reality.<br /><br /> Clockwatchers is all of these things at once. Toni Collette plays the ultra-shy newcomer to Global Credit, the ultimate transnational corporation, who slowly comes to realize that the doomed bond she makes with three other temps is an extremely sacred event in her life. Iris slowly gains confidence through such comradery and at one point she doesn't want to leave, even though her father has higher career expectations for his daughter. Iris comes full circle at the end of the film, confronts one of her many bosses whom plot against her, and atones for not standing with Parker Posey, who is the life of the party as Margaret.<br /><br /> The creators of this film are SO incredibly accurate in revealing what worklife is actually like (the boredom, sharing someone else's space, not knowing someone's name or them not knowing yours), that I felt almost honored to know I wasn't alone. (Movies that are this honest about despair are never depressing.) This is combined by the subtle observations of Iris, which I suppose aren't as exciting as blowing someone's head off or toilet humor, but intriguing nonetheless. It is finally layered with political analysis as the female temps organize a strike. <br /><br /> Suffice it to say, Clockwatchers covers a lot of ground, but the layers are folded well together in a way that makes you care about what happens to these characters and their station in life. A must-see sleeper for those who prefer (for example) Merchant & Ivory over Van Damme & Seagal. 9 out of 10.","Not very many movies come to my mind that covered as much geography as this one.<br /><br />Naturally, being a Hollywood product, there is not a whole lot of realism here, but there is a whole lot of entertainment, and a whole lot of talent.<br /><br />Louis Wollheim apparently never became a household name, but his performance in this film would indicate he should have.<br /><br />In one priceless scene, when, without inter-titles, the Bill Boyd character whispers the explanation of a word (often found in the Bible), Wollheim's expression almost makes the whole movie worthwhile.<br /><br />Lewis Milestone's direction is another plus. This was still early in his career, but his use of inventive angles and a moving camera showed brilliance.<br /><br />Ian Keith made a superb suave villain in one of his best roles.<br /><br />Being a silent film, ""Two Arabian Knights"" probably won't be shown even on Turner Classic Movies very often, but I urge film fans to grab any opportunity to watch it.","The only thing that I can think when reading the negative comments left for this movie is that the people who wrote them have *clearly* never temped. As someone who spent four years of his life wasting away in other people's cubicles, I can tell you with complete authority that this movie gets every mind-numbing, insulting, and degrading aspect of the experience dead on. I suppose you should be thankful if you can't relate to what's going on in this film because it probably means you've never had to tip-toe into some middle manager's office on a Friday afternoon to get a signature on your time card.<br /><br />As for those who think ""Clockwatchers"" is ""dull"" or ""boring,"" it's called subtly. Look into it.",Iraq was in a terrible way LONG before the American came. Saddam was the modern day Stalin and Hitler. Gasing people with different political and religious views and torturing his own people. In the film they show many actual evidence of these acts. They even go back with recored audio of John Kerry agreeing with the invasion of Iraq along with Senetor Clinton and Kennedy.<br /><br />I however like the comparison with the Saddam era Abu Gharib and the American Abu Gharaib. Neither are acceptable but Saddams was MUCH WORSE! We ALL need to see this. <br /><br />10 out of 10. Two thumbs WAY UP!,"I got this movie in the mail a few days ago. I watched it in black and white cause the colour would not appear on my DVD player. Anyway, i saw the whole movie and i was not very pleased about it. The host Mark Taylor a large man in dress suit which tell about what you will see next and say TO MANY times: What you are about to see next is shocking!. Yes, a few things are shocking like the scenes where iraq soldiers breaks bones on prisoners. They also cut tongues of people. At one stage in movie Mark Taylor ask us make up our minds on this: What is worst the Abu Ghraib prison case or what the Iraq army does to people. We are then shown a series of non brutal images from the Abu Ghraib prison followed by extreme grotesque videos from Iraq. This is wrong.<br /><br />The movie it self is very good produced. Good image quality and some neat extra features. But i find this movie to politically incorrect. I have much movies in this genre (shockumentary) but i tend to like them best when they stay without any political views.","This was a waste of time. Out of context video meets out of context prejudice. Quotes are taken from Democrats in supposed support of a war in Iraq (predicated on intelligence provided by the Bush administration) and are seamlessly narrated by our helpful nobody ra-ra, 'my way or the highway', war mongering nobody commentator. The videos are graphic, real and disturbing, but out of place and badly analyzed.<br /><br />Please, put your time to better use. This film will either make you hate 'Islamic Extremists', the 'Radical Left' or just yourself for giving this garbage the time of day.","I found it hard to view the user comments on this film because of all the partisan ranting from demagogues of both parties. Therefore, I am going to try and leave my own political persuasions out of this review although I definitely have a viewpoint about what was happening in Iraq and the need for US involvement there.<br /><br />*** This may contain spoilers, although this is a simple documentary with no plot, so there ain't much to spoil.*** <br /><br />After all the hype about Michael Moore's slanted, biased, and intellectually dishonest film Fahrenheit 911, and all the celebrity hubbub about how George Bush is an evil so-and-so and our involvement in Iraq was simply about obtaining oil, I thought I might have a look at what the other side (who gets far less sensationalistic coverage in the national media) had to say about the whole situation. I had heard that this documentary was particularly brutal and difficult to watch, but I thought it was important to see just what was going on in Iraq before the US dismantled Saddam Hussein's regime.<br /><br />It was brutal, it was grotesque, and it was very difficult to sit through. We are treated to footage of people's arms stretched out across two concrete blocks and then being broken with axe handles; we see fingers hacked off, then the screaming, bleeding victim tossed aside to fend for himself; we see hands amputated surgically and tongues clipped outall these horrific atrocities committed by way of punishment in the name of ""justice"". We see torture, murder, and disturbing footage of women being publicly shot or stoned to death for ""crimes"" such as adultery.<br /><br />My problem is that the documentary, hosted by some boring, no-name yobbo in a suit and tie, frequently wanders from its supposed focus in favor of showing gruesome footage. At first it feels, albeit unpleasant, at least informative; however, as the film wears on, it becomes even more unpleasant, loses its informative nature, and begins to feel distinctly exploitative in tone. I found that shift in tone more disturbing than the film itself. The film ends with every videotaped beheading they could find. I had seen many when they were current news, believing it important to see what the enemy (terrorists and radical religious fundamentalists) was all about, but I just couldn't stomach re-watching these cold-blooded, grotesque murders again, presented as they were in the guise of ""infotainment"", and turned the movie off.<br /><br />In some ways this film shows some important things that were happening within Hussein's Iraq that folks like Sean Penn either didn't see or chose to ignore. It will make you appreciate living in a free country where you don't have your tongue cut out or your hands amputated for displeasing a mad dictator. The US got involved in Bosnia and Somalia based on concern for the genocide occurring there, how could we in fairness turn a blind eye to Iraq? Saddam Hussein actively and arrogant defied every UN sanction and action taken against him, including those he agreed to in order to end the war in 1991, but the UN clearly wasn't going to do anything about it, especially with corrupt UN officials making under-the-table deals with Hussein. Who else but the US would have taken steps to correct this injustice? These are all good points made in the beginning of the film.<br /><br />But the film's weakness is where it loses its focus on the reasons we went there and simply becomes a parade of gore, brutality, and murder. Although it has its good points, I can't in good conscience recommend it as a good, well-made documentary.<br /><br />Cheers <br /><br />Brent","I found ""Lonely Man' in a local library. I can't believe it only has 26 votes on the IMDB. This is not as great as the Anthony Mann films I've studied in grad school. There is one with Anthony Perkins called ""The Tin Star"" which I would recommend more. But, this is still a good Western which doesn't follow the conventional theme/structure narrative. Worth a look.",This film has got merit not least the photography. It is beautifully shot and the location has much to admire. There is a touch of John Ford in parts. Its main strength is the performance by Jack Palance. Anthony Perkins is ok but he has not a lot to do. Small parts by familiar actors adds to the attractions of the film which is well worth a viewing. One of my childhood best loved films which I was not disappointed with when I watched it recently.,"This isn't the cowboys vs. indians or ""saved by the Cavalry"" formulaic western. There is characterization! Jack Palance delivers a great performance. He can act when the script and director allowed him. Tony Perkins seems to be the same character as he was in Tin Star. Great outdoor scenery; the studio should have paid the extra cost to film this in Technicolor.","This film has a lot going for it. It was done in Vistavision a process that gave a superior quality to the film on the screen, and unusually in black and white, since most of the films in Vistavision were in color. The cinematography is great, specially when it shows the wild horses being chased and captured. It has three excellent performances by Jack Palance, Tony Perkins and most of all by Elaine Aiken. Palance is a gunfighter who wants to change his lifestyle but knows that the odds are against it. But he takes upon himself the mission of turning his revolted son Tony Perkins into a better person. In this task he is helped by his former mistress Elaine Aiken with whom he wants no more involvement. There is quite a sensual chemistry between Aiken and Perkins. I wonder why such a talented, good looking woman like Aiken made so few films. It is very hard for a normal father son relationship to develop between Palance an Perkins, and director Henry Levin handles it very well, making the film come to a very satisfactory ending.","Since childhood I've found the actors playing the bad guys more interesting than the main characters,at least till about 1970 or so.Many that I viewed in the 1950's didn't last long in a movie or TV program because they were an early victim to the star.Some eventually went on to make names for their selves but for the most part I liked them more when playing minor roles.Some of those minor role villains are in this movie and I found them very entertaining.There's Neville Brand playing King Fisher,a good performer but sometimes a little bit to scary even for me when dealing out punishment.Others like Faro (Lee Van Cleef),Sundown Whipple(John Doucette) and Blackburn(Claude Akins) are in top menacing form.While not a household name another quality performer is Robert Middleton playing Ben Ryerson.Whether playing a politician or a mob boss he gives a quality performance.In this movie he's a bit grubby looking but handy with both a gun and a knife.Then there's Willie (Elisha Cook Jr) one of Fisher's men.He usually bursts into a room big eyed bearing news but has to grab a quick drink before speaking.So much to my delight the cast includes a rouge's gallery of personal favorites,almost like a dream come true.For those who like the good guys the movie leans more towards a nightmare.Jack Palance plays Jacob Wade the main character.As usual he has the look of a strong tough looking man.His performance is better than usual but that just means it's not as stiff as usual.The story lacks a bit of direction also.Those two points are forgotten because of Anthony Perkins who plays Jacob Wade's son Riley.His part lacks direction or maybe a director as it seems like he or someone else wants to sabotage this movie.First off he's too old and big to be playing the part of the son.When he does show some sign of a emotion it's fitting more for someone at least 10 years younger than him.To the simple statement that his mother(deceased) was a fine woman he responds blandly""talk about my mother again and I'll kill you"",really off the wall.Elaine Aiken gives a good performance and is nice looking.In another comment it was basically said her character with it's good qualities has no reason to be interested romantically in the wimpy Perkins character,that's hitting the nail on the head.So this movie was just about what I expected,the minor roles out shining the main characters.One of the main characters looked like a good friend must of gave them the part.","The third movie produced by Howard Hughes, this gem was thought to be lost. It was recently restored and shown on TCM (12/15/04). The plot is a familiar one - two WW I soldiers escape from a German prison camp (guarded by an extremely lethargic German shepherd, who practically guides them out of the camp), stow away on a ship, and end up in ""Arabia"", where they rescue the lovely Mary Astor. The restoration is very good overall, although there are two or three very rough sequences. The production is very good, and there are some very funny scenes. And did I mention that Mary Astor is in it? The film won an Academy Award for the now-defunct category of ""Best Direction of a Comedy"".","Jacob Wade (Jack Palance) used to be a celebrated shootist just stepping into middle age and mortally weary of having to be asked to leave every town he rides into To make matters worse, a few notorious outlaws, led by the vile King (Neville Brand), are also out to take him down <br /><br />Now he tries to do something for his boy Riley (Anthony Perkins) by catching and breaking mustangs in Echo Canyon, the best wild horse country in the territory <br /><br />Complicating the situations further is Jacob's bad relationship with a kid who hates him, and Ada Marshall (Elaine Aiken), a young woman whom Jacob met in a gambling hall, and shot a man on account of her<br /><br />Here is a thinking person's Western that deals with one ex-gunman who also is unable to shake his past and whose ultimate goal for taking root again is by lynching <br /><br />Levin shows a dark, depressing, and sadly realistic face of the west... In fact, the entire movie is a drama of characters But watching the film, you would be able to feel how Levin equates victory with redemption","Turner Classic Movies showed this silent, B&W flick today (Aug 29, 2007) on TV.<br /><br />Solid classic adventure story, complete with all of the key ingredients: exotic plot locations, a beautiful woman in peril, a pair of dauntless and resourceful heroes (one of them handsome, the other colorful) grossly outnumbered by badguys, sprinkled with comic relief. Great costumes and sets; as good or better than those of current movies. Surprising variety of camera craft and directorship; pans and zooms including overhead angles, and closeups of key characters and objects. In this regard again it seems like a modern movie! Actions convey the story very well; without the benefit of a soundtrack. Of course, this entails a considerable degree of live type acting (similar to that seen in plays), but I did not get a feeling of melodrama like is all too common in most silent films and early sound movies.<br /><br />The most enjoyable performance is played by Louis Wolheim as the rough edged but colorful Sgt. Peter O'Gaffney, who was *perfectly* casted for the role; considering both appearance and skill.<br /><br />There were at least a few peculiar facts about Muslim society that I had previously learned over the past several years, which added to my appreciation of the story in the area of historical accuracy.<br /><br />My favorite scene was when the heroes are fleeing a swarm of dangerous, sword wielding Arabs through the narrow streets of a busy Muslim city. Suddenly though the chase is interrupted by an oblivious imam who pops out onto an exterior balcony to announce that it's time for afternoon prayer. Everyone out on the streets (except for the heroes) religiously obeys Islamic law and momentarily kneels down, which allows the heroes to escape. That scene was just one example of the film's many expressions of originality.<br /><br />After seeing this movie I better realize how extensively modern movies contain rehashed ideas that were pioneered decades earlier.","Enjoyed viewing this 1927 Silent Film from the past and seeing great Classic actors like Mary Astor, William Boyd and Boris Karloff. The film depicts two soldiers fighting in the trenches of WWI and wearing gas masks against the Mustard Gas that the Germans were using to kill the American Forces in Europe. William Boyd,(Pvt W. Dangerfield Phelps),""Hopalong Cassidy"",'49 TV Series, was a green horn to fighting in the muddy trenches and meets up with a veteran soldier, Louis Walheim,(Sgt.Peter McGaffney),""The Sin Ship"",'31, who gave Pvt. Dangerfield a very hard time during half of the picture. The two soldiers meet up with Mary Astor,(Anis bin Adham/Miraz),""Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte','64, who wears a veil over her face and charms the two soldiers into paying for her fare on their voyage. If you look real close, you will see Boris Karloff,(Purser)""Targets"",'68, who was the purser on the ship and was just starting his career with a minor role in this Army life comedy, at the age of 40 years. Howard Huges produced this picture for UA and was the first film to win an Academy Award for its direction. If you want to see a great Silent Film from 1927, you will definitely enjoy this CLASSIC!","Like TWO ARABIAN KNIGHTS, a couple of American soldiers attempt the daring rescue of a Middle Eastern princess from a loveless betrothal.<br /><br />Producer Howard Hughes became a Hollywood power with the very successful release of this, his third motion picture. Thought lost for decades, this wonderful silent comedy has recently been rediscovered & restored and given a splendid orchestral score by Robert Israel. Directed with verve by Lewis Milestone and greatly benefiting from William Cameron Menzies' art direction, the high jinks & high adventure of this antique buddy film are once again ready to delight the viewing audience.<br /><br />Clean-cut private William Boyd and plug-ugly sergeant Louis Wolheim battle Germans, Arabs and each other across Europe, the Mediterranean and into Palestine. They make a terrific comedy duo, constantly involved in one-upmanship and dangerous exploits whether in a POW camp, on a prisoner train, aboard a tramp steamer, or in a Moslem souk and emir's palace. Wolheim, with his hilariously expressive face, has a slight advantage in the scene stealing category, while Boyd has the upper hand in the romantics department.<br /><br />Mary Astor, as the endangered princess, is the willing recipient of Boyd's attentions. Her role doesn't give her a great deal to do except look lovely & alarmed, but these she carries off admirably.<br /><br />In the supporting cast, Michael Visaroff is the black hearted ship's captain who comes into conflict with Boyd & Wolheim; look fast for Boris Karloff as his purser. Dashing Ian Keith nicely plays the young Arab chieftain who will stop at nothing to make Astor his bride.<br /><br />At various points throughout the movie the viewer will notice the deterioration of the film stock, showing that TWO ARABIAN KNIGHTS was indeed rescued, like the princess, just in time.","TWO ARABIAN KNIGHTS has been restored by Flicker Alley and TCM after being unavailable for decades. The film is the only recipient of the ""Best Direction of a Comedy Film"" Academy Award that was only given out in 1927-1928. William Boyd and Louis Wolheim are two feuding G.I.s that are both captured by the Germans in World War I. The film is more of an adventure/comedy rather than a straight comedy. They have a suspenseful escape from their prison camp, only to be recaptured and sent to Turkey. They end up being stuck on a train, and a ship, as well as well as being marked for death by an Arab suitor. A very young and beautiful Mary Astor is a veiled woman who boards the ship and is a target of romantic advances by both men. Look fast to spot a very young Boris Karloff as the ship purser. Louis Wolheim has a face only a mother could love, but he is perfect in his part as the gruff sergeant.<br /><br />I'm not sure how this film could have beaten out Chaplin's THE CIRCUS, Keaton's STEAMBOAT BILL, JR. and Harold Lloyd's SPEEDY for the ""comedy direction"" Oscar. Still, it is a fun, sophisticated, and exciting film that is well written. I particularly liked the scene where they escape from a jam with a little help from God (or Allah). If you like silent films, you won't be disappointed.","TCM came through by acquiring this wonderful, silent, comedy/drama for television. Until recently it had been locked away in an achieve somewhere. It premiered on TV for the 1st time since its theatrical release in 1927. Two Americans fighting in World War I (William Boyd and Louis Wolheim) are hiding in a defensive position with German soldiers advancing. They however are fighting with each other and working the nerve of one-an-other. They of course are caught, but after an inventive escape they are taken on a whirlwind adventure in Arabia, with all the humor you might find in an Abbott and Costello movie. Very funny and sometimes even touching. A great silent picture and winner of an Academy Award for ""Best Comedy Direction"". Directed by Lewis Milestone."
